# Realtek Audio Driver Mods by Alan Finotty

* Features

ALL driver INFs contained in this package are in the [**Universal (DCH)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-a-universal-inf-file) standard. The legacy audio manager will continue to be used temporarily, because in this package, in the future, I will try to deploy the Realtek Audio Console (UWP). The packages that will be in this repository support Windows 10 exclusively. More compatibility information below.

* Compatibility

This driver package is supported only on Windows 10 systems starting from Windows 10 Creators Update (1703+) (NT 10.0.15063.0).

* Uninstalling the package for migration to other Realtek driver packages.

When you remove this driver package, everything that was selected at the time of installation will be removed (including in previous systems). The Dolby Atmos, Nahimic 3 and Sound Blaster Connect 2 apps will be removed. The main driver, extension drivers and software components will also have their copies removed from the system cache **(%systemroot%\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository)**.

* Purpose of this project

Help those who have a motherboard with a Realtek audio chip and who want to extract superior audio quality in music, movies, games or other content.

I hope to be able to help all internet users interested in these packages.
